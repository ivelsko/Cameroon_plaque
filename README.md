# Plaque samples from Cameroon

This repository is for keeping the data processing and analysis of dental plaque samples 
from populations in rural Cameroon somewhat organized. This includes sequencing 
statistics, taxonomic, and functional analyses. These samples are compared within each 
other using the various metadata categories collected (village, age, sex, market economy, 
tooth site), and are compared to published dental plaque and dental calculus from 
industrialized European/American populations. 


## Overview about the repository

* `00-documentation`: files with general information about the samples and
  sequencing data
* `02-scripts.backup`: scripts for sample processing and analysis
* `05-results.backup`: results from the data analysis that can stand alone, 
  meaning they aren't strictly used as input for another step
